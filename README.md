# ðŸš€ One-Click NixOS Install on Hetzner Cloud

## Quick Start (for Beginners)

1. **Create a Hetzner Cloud server**
   - Choose Ubuntu or Debian as the OS (default is fine).
   - Note the server's IP address and root password (from Hetzner dashboard).

2. **On your Mac or Linux computer:**
   - Open Terminal.
   - Download and run the install script:
     ```sh
     curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youruser/yourrepo/main/install-hetzner.sh -o install-hetzner.sh
     chmod +x install-hetzner.sh
     ./install-hetzner.sh <SERVER_IP> <ROOT_PASSWORD>
     ```
     Replace `<SERVER_IP>` and `<ROOT_PASSWORD>` with your server's details.

3. **Wait for the script to finish.**
   - Your server will reboot into NixOS automatically!
